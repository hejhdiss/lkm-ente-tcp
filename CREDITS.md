## ENTE-TCP Development

**Date:** February 2025

## Original Work

This project is based on **NDM-TCP** (Neural Differential Manifolds TCP):
- **Repository:** https://github.com/hejhdiss/lkm-ndm-tcp
- **Original Author:** @hejhdiss
- **Concept:** Using neural networks and entropy for TCP congestion control

## What ENTE-TCP Is

ENTE-TCP is a **simplified, ML-free version** of NDM-TCP that:
- Removes all neural network components
- Keeps the core entropy-based congestion detection
- Makes the algorithm transparent and understandable
- Uses only classical if-else logic for decision making

## Code Generation

All code in this repository was generated by **Claude Sonnet 4.5**, an AI assistant by Anthropic, based on the NDM-TCP implementation. The generation process involved:

1. Analyzing the original NDM-TCP kernel module
2. Identifying core entropy calculation logic
3. Removing neural network layers, weights, and learning mechanisms
4. Simplifying decision logic to pure entropy thresholds
5. Adding extensive documentation and comments
6. Creating build system and comprehensive README
